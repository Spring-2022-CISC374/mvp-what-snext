*Its just a sleepover...*

*What could go wrong?*

**Elevator [scene 2]**

*Who is this guy?*

*Why is he so close?* 

*He's been following me ever since I left Mom* 

*I better get out quick*

**Floor 10 Hallway [scene 3]**

*He's still here, this is getting weird.* 

*What should I do?* 

- Start yelling. 

  - YOU: WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

  - RANDOM GUY: Dude I think that kid is being harrassed.

  - OTHER RANDOM GUY: Maybe we should keep an eye on him.

- Call Mom. 

  - CONCERNED MOM: Hi Sweetie, is everything alright?

  - YOU: I don't know

  - CONCERNED MOM: Do you want me to come get you?

  - YOU: No, I'm almost at Bestie's house.

  - CONCERNED MOM: Okay, I'll stay on the phone with you, until you get there then.

- Ignore.

  - I'm sure he just lives in the building.

  - Screaming for help would be embarrassing anyways.
